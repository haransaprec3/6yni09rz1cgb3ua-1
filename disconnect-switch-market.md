<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disconnect Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fused</li><li>Non-Fused</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disconnect switch market is primarily divided into two types: fused and non-fused disconnect switches. Fused disconnect switches incorporate fuses that provide overcurrent protection, allowing for safer isolation of electrical circuits. They are commonly used in settings where equipment safety is a priority. In contrast, non-fused disconnect switches lack built-in fuses and are typically used in applications where overcurrent protection is already handled by upstream devices. Both types serve essential functions in managing electrical supply and ensuring safety.</p></p>
